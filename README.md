I build reliable, memory-safe systems in Rust and I'm actively refining my Rust craft with a focus on practical AI integration. I bring production systems experience and on-call discipline, and I'm exploring how Rust can power efficient, trustworthy AI-backed services and developer tooling.

## Quick facts
- **Experience:** 6+ years in production systems & cloud operations
- **Current role:** Technology Associate @ Innovations for Poverty Action (Kenya)
- **Focus:** Rust backend services, async systems, infra-as-code, and lightweight AI integrations
- **Availability:** Open to junior → mid-level Rust backend / systems roles (available full-time from Q1 2026)

## Tech stack (high level)
- **Languages:** Rust, Python
- **Rust stack:** Tokio, Axum, SQLx, serde, tracing
- **AI & tooling:** experimenting with LLM APIs, embeddings, and Rust-native inference bindings; using AI to speed development and testing workflows
- **Infra & tooling:** Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, Azure, CI/CD pipelines
- **Datastores:** PostgreSQL, SQLite, Redis

## What I bring to a team
- Production mindset: zero-downtime deployments, incident response, and observable systems
- Systems-first thinking: defensive design to reduce blast radius and recovery time
- Automation-first: if it repeats twice, automate it — now exploring AI-assisted automation for code gen and testing
- Pragmatic integration of AI: focus on composability, cost, and safety when adding AI features

## Learning projects & interests (AI + Rust)
- Prototyping small inference services and embedding pipelines in Rust for low-latency features
- Building CLIs and developer tools that use AI to automate repetitive tasks and improve DX
- Rewriting legacy tooling to be memory-safe, faster, and easier to operate in production
- Experimenting with AI-assisted testing, fuzzing, and documentation generation for Rust codebases

I'm interested in roles where I can continue to sharpen Rust skills and help teams adopt safe, performant patterns for building AI-backed services. If you have a role that needs someone pragmatic and curious about Rust + AI, let's talk.
