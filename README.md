## 🔧 What I Do

Technology Associate at Innovations for Poverty Action (Kenya), managing production systems and cloud operations. Outside work, I build with Rust—focusing on async services, lightweight AI pipelines, and infrastructure automation.

**Current focus areas:**
- Async web services with Tokio and Axum
- Embedding pipelines and inference integration
- Developer tooling and CLI applications
- Infrastructure as code with Terraform and Kubernetes

## 💡 What I Value

I build systems that are observable, maintainable, and safe to operate. I automate repetitive work, write defensive code, and treat production incidents as learning opportunities. Always improving.
