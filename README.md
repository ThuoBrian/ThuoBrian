Experienced backend engineer with a strong Ops background and a focus on building reliable, memory-safe systems in Rust. I combine on-call discipline and production systems experience with modern Rust tooling to deliver high-performance services and infrastructure automation.

## Quick facts
- **Years experience:** 6+ years in production systems & cloud operations
- **Current role:** Technology Associate @ Innovations for Poverty Action (Kenya)
- **Primary focus:** Rust backend services, async systems, and infrastructure-as-code
- **Availability:** Open to junior → mid-level Rust backend / systems roles (available full-time from Q1 2026)

## Tech stack (high level)
- **Languages:** Rust, shell scripting
- **Rust stack:** Tokio, Axum, SQLx, serde, tracing
- **Infra & tooling:** Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, Azure, CI/CD pipelines
- **Datastores:** PostgreSQL, SQLite, Redis

## What I bring to a team
- Zero-downtime deployment discipline and incident response experience
- Deep understanding of how distributed systems fail in production
- A pragmatic automation-first mindset: "If it repeats twice, automate it"
- Experience containerizing services and building CI/CD workflows for reliability

## Selected work & interests
- Building production-grade backends and async microservices in Rust
- Rewriting operational tools and CLIs to be memory-safe and performant
- Secure file-processing pipelines and WebSocket services

# Brian Gachau Thuo
**Rust Backend Engineer (in training) | 6+ years Production Systems & Cloud Ops**
Currently Technology Associate @ Innovations for Poverty Action (Kenya)

From keeping 100+ mission-critical systems alive 24/7 to rebuilding them in memory-safe, blazing-fast Rust.

### What my Ops background gives me:
- Zero-downtime deployment discipline
- Incident response reflexes (on-call muscle memory)
- Deep knowledge of how distributed systems actually fail in production
- “If it’s repeated twice, automate it” mindset baked in since 2018

### What I’m doing with Rust right now (shipping weekly):
- Building production-grade backends with **Axum + SQLx + Tokio**
- Async microservices, WebSocket services, secure file-processing CLIs
- All projects public, tested, containerized, with clean READMEs

### Current Tech Stack
**Rust** • Tokio • Axum • SQLx • serde • tracing
**Infra** • Docker • Kubernetes • Terraform • Azure • Linux • CI/CD
**Databases** • PostgreSQL • SQLite • Redis

### Looking for
**Junior to Mid-Level Rust Backend / Systems / Infrastructure Engineer** roles
Remote-first preferred • Available full-time from **Q1 2026**

If you need someone who already thinks like a senior engineer but writes Rust like someone hungry to prove it — let’s talk.
