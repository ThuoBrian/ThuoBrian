# Brian Gachau Thuo  
**Rust Backend Engineer (in training) | 6+ years Production Systems & Cloud Ops**  
Currently Technology Associate @ Innovations for Poverty Action (Kenya)

From keeping 100+ mission-critical systems alive 24/7 to rebuilding them in memory-safe, blazing-fast Rust.

### What my Ops background gives me:
- Zero-downtime deployment discipline
- Incident response reflexes (on-call muscle memory)
- Deep knowledge of how distributed systems actually fail in production
- “If it’s repeated twice, automate it” mindset baked in since 2018

### What I’m doing with Rust right now (shipping weekly):
- Building production-grade backends with **Axum + SQLx + Tokio**
- Rewriting internal IPA tools (inventory, workflows, monitoring) in Rust
- Async microservices, WebSocket services, secure file-processing CLIs
- All projects public, tested, containerized, with clean READMEs

### Current Tech Stack
**Rust** • Tokio • Axum • SQLx • serde • tracing  
**Infra** • Docker • Kubernetes • Terraform • Azure • Linux • CI/CD  
**Databases** • PostgreSQL • SQLite • Redis

### Looking for
**Junior to Mid-Level Rust Backend / Systems / Infrastructure Engineer** roles  
Remote-first preferred • Available full-time from **Q1 2026**

If you need someone who already thinks like a senior engineer but writes Rust like someone hungry to prove it — let’s talk.
