# Hi, I'm Brian 👋

I'm a backend engineer learning Rust and exploring how it intersects with AI and infrastructure. I enjoy building reliable systems and automating away repetitive work.

## What I'm working on

Currently a Technology Associate at Innovations for Poverty Action in Kenya, where I work on production systems and cloud operations. In my own time, I'm deepening my Rust knowledge by building small projects that combine backend services with practical AI features.

Some things I'm exploring:
- Async web services with Tokio and Axum
- Lightweight inference and embedding pipelines
- Developer tooling and CLI applications
- Infrastructure automation with Terraform and Kubernetes

## Technologies I work with

**Languages:** Rust, Python  
**Backend:** Tokio, Axum, SQLx, serde  
**Data:** PostgreSQL, SQLite, Redis  
**Infrastructure:** Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, Azure, CI/CD  
**AI experimentation:** LLM APIs, embeddings, Rust inference bindings

## What I value

I care about systems that are observable, maintainable, and safe to operate. I believe in automating repetitive tasks, writing defensive code, and learning from production incidents. I'm still early in my Rust journey but I'm committed to writing better software every day.

## Open to opportunities

I'm looking for junior to mid-level Rust backend or systems engineering roles starting Q1 2026. If you're building something interesting with Rust, especially at the intersection of infrastructure and AI, I'd love to connect.
